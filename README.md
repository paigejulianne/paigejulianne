Greetings! Iâ€™m Paige Julianne, a seasoned software engineer residing in the vibrant Research Triangle region of North Carolina. As a passionate advocate for inclusivity, I proudly identify as a lesbian transwoman, and I am blessed with two amazing daughters from my first marriage.

My journey in the world of coding began back in 1989, but I have been professionally honing my skills since 1996. Over the years, I have cultivated a deep affinity for PHP, making it my preferred language for creating exceptional software solutions.

Presently, I have the privilege of serving as the REDCap administrator and programmer at the renowned Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium (METRC), headquartered at the esteemed Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Additionally, I am currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in health information management at Western Governorâ€™s University (WGU), further expanding my expertise in this field.

Throughout my illustrious career, I have had the opportunity to contribute my talents to esteemed organizations such as AT&T, Cisco, IBM, North Carolina State University, and MCI/Worldcom (now Verizon Business). My repertoire includes developing a diverse range of web applications, ranging from eCommerce platforms to comprehensive systems management solutions. Moreover, I embarked on an entrepreneurial venture as the proprietor of Concert Telecommunications, my own Voice-over-IP telecommunications firm, which I successfully managed for six years. In 2013, I proudly graduated from the prestigious Kauffman FastTrac TechVenture program, facilitated by the esteemed Council for Entrepreneurial Development (CED NC).

With a wealth of experience and an unwavering passion for innovation, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
