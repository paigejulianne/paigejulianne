Hello, I am Paige Julianne, a seasoned software engineer based in the vibrant Research Triangle area of North Carolina. I am a proud lesbian transwoman and a parent to two wonderful daughters from my first marriage.

I started my journey in coding in 1989 and have been honing my skills professionally since 1996. I have developed a strong affinity for PHP and consider it my preferred language for creating exceptional software solutions.

Currently, I am the REDCap administrator and programmer at the Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium (METRC), based at the prestigious Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Additionally, I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Technology Management at Western Governorsâ€™ University (WGU) to further enhance my expertise in this field.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with esteemed organizations such as AT&T, Cisco, IBM, North Carolina State University, and MCI/Worldcom (now Verizon Business). My work involves developing various web applications, including eCommerce platforms and comprehensive systems management solutions.

I also ventured into entrepreneurship as the owner of Concert Telecommunications, my own voice-over-IP telecommunications company, which I successfully managed for six years. In 2013, I graduated from the renowned Kauffman FastTrac TechVenture program, facilitated by the esteemed Council for Entrepreneurial Development (CED NC).

With my extensive experience and unwavering passion for innovation, I am dedicated to making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving technology landscape.
